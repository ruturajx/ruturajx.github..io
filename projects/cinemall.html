            <p>
                Imagine listening to the iconic Rocky theme song but not associating it with Sylvester Stallone’s training montage.
                Audio and video work together to create an immersive cinematic experience. When one piece is missing,
                you risk degrading the integrity of the whole movie. Unfortunately, this is the reality for people with
                moderate to severe visual impairments.

            <h2>Process Overview</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted research by means of observation, interviews, walkthroughs and online resources to understand how the visually impaired watch movies and the pain points in the process of their usage. We analyzed the gathered data using affinity mapping and created journey maps. This helped us understand the pain points across the process and gave us a direction in terms of our solution goals. We brainstormed and after creating a feasibility vs impact chart, came up with 3 different design ideas and got feedback on those. Eventually we picked one of the ideas and after multiple iterations CinemAll came to life.
                <br>The CinemAll mobile application aims to replace bulky and obtrusive video description headsets for users with visual impairments. Instead of having to rent used theater equipment, users can now leverage their own devices and headsets to more closely replicate the standard movie-watching experience.

            <p>
                Everyone was equally involved from the research phase till we shortlisted our 3 design ideas. In the research phase, I conducted interviews and walkthroughs at movie theaters and also created a detailed task analysis for the process of using DV devices. I also studied the solutions currently available in the market.
                I was responsible for creating sketches and low fidelity wireframes in balsamiq for two of the ideas of which one became our final solution. I iterated on the low-fi wireframe based on the feedback and later Danielle and I created the high fidelity wireframe in Sketch.
                I was responsible for creating the hi-fi prototype in JustinMind.
                Conducted user tests during the evaluation phase of the project.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                Initially our team had decided to focus on improving the grocery shopping experience for the visually impaired customers. During our first initial interview, the topic of in-theater experience and the problems associated with it came up. It tweaked our interest and due to the liberty of a class project, we were able to pivot from our original topic and started working on this problem space. Thus problem space was also finalized with user research.<br>
                We conducted observations, semi-structured interviews, field visits and also conducted walkthroughs of the movie watching process to understand the problem space. All four of the team members visited different movie theaters, two of us watched a movie using a Descriptive Video (DV) device and the other two talked to the manager and theater associates to gain insights from them on the process.
                We also dived into the online blind community by visiting government websites, existing solutions and user reviews of them, and online message boards such as reddit.com/r/blind. We were looking for user pain points using DV devices while visiting movie theatres.

                simple and easily implementable to outlandishly complex. We brainstormed and refined them to total of 18 ideas.
                Finally, we decided to narrow down our scope by figuring out what was important to both our users and stakeholders.
                We did this by breaking down our ideas and design criteria into a visual representation using a <b class="text-black">Feasibility vs. User Impact Chart</b>.
                We choose 3 ideas from these and decided to create sketches and low fidelity wireframes for these ideas.

                This solution aimed to cut out interaction with theater associates, who are often times under-trained and
                cause unnecessary frustrations for visually impaired moviegoers. Additionally, we envisioned the kiosks
                to be a universal solution and a one-stop shop for all moviegoers to purchase or pickup tickets and retrieve
                assistive devices. While we are focused on the visually impaired, this solution could also have a broader
                adaptation for those who need different types of assistance, such as hearing devices.

                We used a combination of expert and user testing in order to test the performance of our application design.
                Within these categories we used techniques including cognitive walkthroughs, unstructured interviews,
                benchmark tasks, the SUS Scale, and a post-task questionnaire in order to get a variety of different
                types of feedback including by including both quantitative and qualitative measures.

            <h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>When we embarked on this project, we were all excited to design for a population we were unfamiliar
                    with. We saw it as a challenge and knew we had to rigorously follow the design process in order to
                    make sure we kept the best interests of these users in mind. However, designing for this population
                    proved to be a challenge on multiple occasions.
                </li>
                <li>Design proved difficult and tedious because we have to be meticulous along every step of the way that
                    our system met accessibility standards for various types of visual impairments. Also, it was hard to
                    find prototyping tools that would support all of the functionality that we wanted to have (animations,
                    screen reader, video, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>Evaluations were difficult because it is a hard population to get ahold of. We only had a limited amount
                    of access and we were trying to make sure not to exhaust our resources too early. In some cases, our
                    resources were very willing to help, but could not meet our needs in terms of meeting time deadlines.
                    This class moves through the design process fairly quickly, so we had to keep moving and improvise at times.
                </li>
