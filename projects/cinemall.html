            <p>
                Imagine listening to the iconic Rocky theme song but not associating it with Sylvester Stallone’s training montage.
                Audio and video work together to create an immersive cinematic experience. When one piece is missing,
                you risk degrading the integrity of the whole movie. Unfortunately, this is the reality for people with
                moderate to severe visual impairments.

            <h2>Process Overview</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted research by means of observation, interviews, walkthroughs and online resources to understand how the visually impaired watch movies and the pain points in the process of their usage. We analyzed the gathered data using affinity mapping and created journey maps. This helped us understand the pain points across the process and gave us a direction in terms of our solution goals. We brainstormed and after creating a feasibility vs impact chart, came up with 3 different design ideas and got feedback on those. Eventually we picked one of the ideas and after multiple iterations CinemAll came to life.
                <br>The CinemAll mobile application aims to replace bulky and obtrusive video description headsets for users with visual impairments. Instead of having to rent used theater equipment, users can now leverage their own devices and headsets to more closely replicate the standard movie-watching experience.

            <p>
                Everyone was equally involved from the research phase till we shortlisted our 3 design ideas. In the research phase, I conducted interviews and walkthroughs at movie theaters and also created a detailed task analysis for the process of using DV devices. I also studied the solutions currently available in the market.
                I was responsible for creating sketches and low fidelity wireframes in balsamiq for two of the ideas of which one became our final solution. I iterated on the low-fi wireframe based on the feedback and later Danielle and I created the high fidelity wireframe in Sketch.
                I was responsible for creating the hi-fi prototype in JustinMind.
                Conducted user tests during the evaluation phase of the project.

        <p style="font-size: 10px">For the purpose of this project we will refer to the visually impaired as those users who have moderate to severe visual impairment (Snellen visual acuity: 20/70 to 20/400 range), possibly extending to profoundly visually impaired users that fall into the 20/500 - 20/1000 range. More precisely, this user group will be defined as moviegoers or potential moviegoers who prefer to use a DV device when visiting a movie theater.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                Initially our team had decided to focus on improving the grocery shopping experience for the visually impaired customers. During our first initial interview, the topic of in-theater experience and the problems associated with it came up. It tweaked our interest and due to the liberty of a class project, we were able to pivot from our original topic and started working on this problem space. Thus problem space was also finalized with user research.<br>
                We conducted observations, semi-structured interviews, field visits and also conducted walkthroughs of the movie watching process to understand the problem space. All four of the team members visited different movie theaters, two of us watched a movie using a Descriptive Video (DV) device and the other two talked to the manager and theater associates to gain insights from them on the process.
                We also dived into the online blind community by visiting government websites, existing solutions and user reviews of them, and online message boards such as reddit.com/r/blind. We were looking for user pain points using DV devices while visiting movie theatres.
