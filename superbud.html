            <p class="feature-title">Selected Problem Prompt</p>
            <p>Mentoring can be a great way to share knowledge and help someone be successful in their personal or
                professional
                life. But many potential mentors are often too busy to commit to regular meetings, or they have a hard
                time
                connecting with people seeking help. Design an experience where prospective mentors and mentees can be
                matched,
                based on similar interests, location, and availability.</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle">Understanding the problem space</p>
            <p class="feature-title">Desktop Research</p>
            <p> I started out by reading about mentorship programmes and tried finding existing products that have a
                mentorship
                component. What I studied included <b>Shapr</b> and <b>Facebook groups mentorship feature</b>.
                A common review about both these products were that people were not active on them.
                Just connecting people and making sure they keep in touch are very different things.<br>

            <p class="feature-title">Scoping out the problem</p>
            <p> Initially I interviewed 4 people who were involved in the <b>MentorJacket</b>, <b> GT LEAD </b> program
                and the
                <b>MS-HCI mentorship programme</b>. <br>Mentorship is a very broad concept and the answer
                to what mentorship means to everyone varies a lot. Considering the time frame and access to target
                users,
                I decided to narrow down the scope to analyse the existing MS-HCI mentorship program and try to improve
                it

            <p> I conducted 5 more interviews with current MS-HCI students and alumni to understand their

            <p class="vertical-divider">Low participation in the mentorship program. Especially mentor side.</p>

            <p class="vertical-divider">Most were unhappy with the mentor matches which were decided by a committee of 5
                student representatives</p>

            <p class="vertical-divider">Mentors & Mentees rarely met after the initiation party</p>

            <p class="vertical-divider"> Assigned mentor isn’t always right person to get help from on all topics.</p>

            <p class="vertical-divider">Most were unaware of what their peers were doing in the program. Didn’t know
                whom to approach for help.</p>

            <p class="vertical-divider">Common rhetoric: "I didn’t gain anything so I don’t feel like giving back."</p>

            <p>Due to time constraint, I could not conduct comprehensive usability testing for SuperBud. However I let
                two of the interview participants
                try out the prototypes and they reacted very positively with the overall concept. </p>
            <p class="vertical-divider">The feed is interesting and would love to keep up with important deadlines and
                fun work by everyone else in one place! But should not feel like information overload</p>
            <p class="vertical-divider">The mentorship assistant is very promising. I’d like to see more fleshed out
                version of this. </p>

            <p>Users didn’t understand what just “XX%” number mean on the recommendation card. Upon conveying the
                meaning, one user
                said I’d like to see that number while the other said the number doesn’t matter at all and she expected
                results
                to be in decreasing order of match by default. I added label instead of removing the number, but more
                testing required</p>

                <b>Grow beyond campus</b><br>
                This application could expand into multiple communities residing in the same app like how Slack
                handles multiple workplaces. Alumni starting out their careers could then be active on their company
                workplace while also checking the HCI program workplace from time to time.
                <br><br>


                <b>Privacy concerns & user control over data</b><br>
                I would handle privacy and user control over their data in a better way as my next steps. Which would
                increase the trust in the system.
                <br><br>

                <b>Limited features explained</b><br>
                Due to time limitation I could not explain all the features and sub features of the application and have
                assumed usual functioning of features like Advanced Filters, creating and updating profiles and
                preferences.
                All these sub components of the app have scope to expand.

                <b>Routine usage</b><br>
                Do people come back to this app on a regular basis to check out their feed even after being connected to
                mentors they wished for. Just like everyone checks their instagram at least once a day. (if not more!)
                <br><br>

                <b>Network effect</b><br>
                Does this application undergo the Network effect phenomenon. The value will certainly add with more
                users using this system because at the core of it all, it’s just a way to connect and stay connected
                with people.
                <br><br>
                <b>Feeling of Giving back</b><br>
                Using such an application, I believe that a sense of community could be created within the program and
                would be beneficial for everyone. Everyone needs help at some point and having a feeling that my
                community
                helped me out will certainly increase motivation for students who have used this system while in college
                to
                be active even after they graduate to help out their juniors. Inducing the feeling of giving back to my
                program
                could be the biggest value addition. It has to start somewhere!

            <p>I took the approach of “solve local problem with a global outlook” which helped me channel my efforts
                to come up with a solution relevant to my program but also has the potential to grow into something much
                larger.
                I acknowledge that this solution has a multiple ways to grow, but I thoroughly
                enjoyed thinking about this problem and I am proud of my solution. Maybe one day we’ll have something
                similar for our MS-HCI community.
